<h1>Hi, I'm Yoonhee!</h1>

<p style="text-transform: none;"> 
  I’m currently an Honours student in Quantitative Finance at the University of Technology Sydney, where I’m conducting honours research on "Optimal Quantization in Option Pricing under Non-Log Dynamics."<br><br>

  I previously completed my Bachelor’s degree in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sydney, where I discovered my passion for research during the final-year coursework. Although I initially explored the financial industry to gain work experience, I quickly realised that I was more drawn to solving theoretical problems and pursuing work that can fulfil my curiosity.<br><br>

  This realisation led me back to academia through the Honours program, and I’m now actively interested in gaining experience as a Quantitative Trader while continuing to explore opportunities for research in Quantitative Finance.
